# Unexpected Modification of Instance Variable in Ruby

This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Ruby related to modifying instance variables directly from outside a class's methods.  While Ruby allows this, it often leads to unexpected behavior or errors if not carefully handled.  The `bug.rb` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rb` provides a safer approach.
